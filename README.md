# Toll-Plaza-System
Object oriented paradigm using C++.
 Toll management system is the most important part of a Highway Project. This is the system that will enable the toll operating agency to efficiently and securely collect toll from the road user. Here, in this project we have enabled these features through programming concept and all these components have been included in our projects in order to manage the data and records. These data and records includes the basic information of bus truck and other vehicles,  how much it will cost for vehicles to carry that particular number of load, also what is the pickup point and destination point for every vehicles. This system allows us to store the data and records of toll fee and payment collected in a single day or a month. We have also included the feature of collecting the fee of both return type vehicles and collected fee for them. In this project we have made the feature as this system will not collect any fee from special category vehicles and categorized them as exempted vehicles whose toll fee wonâ€™t be charged.
